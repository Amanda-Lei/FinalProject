var hopperText = "Grace Hopper was a computer scientist and United States Navyrear admiral.  She was a pioneer of computer programming who popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages. Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale University and was a professor of mathematics at Vassar College. Hopper joined the Navy Reserves and was part of the team that developed the UNIVAC I computer. At Eckertâ€“Mauchly she began developing the compiler. She believed that a programming language based on English was possible. Her compiler converted English terms into machine code understood by computers. At the age of 79, she was the oldest officer on active U.S. naval duty when she retired again in 1986."
