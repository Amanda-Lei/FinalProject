          Grace Hopper was a computer scientist and United States Navyrear admiral.  She was a pioneer of computer programming who popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages. Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale University and was a professor of mathematics at Vassar College. Hopper joined the Navy Reserves and was part of the team that developed the UNIVAC I computer. At Eckert–Mauchly she began developing the compiler. She believed that a programming language based on English was possible. Her compiler converted English terms into machine code understood by computers. At the age of 79, she was the oldest officer on active U.S. naval duty when she retired again in 1986.

        <p id="ilanaText" >Karlie Kloss is an American supermodel, entrepreneur.  Karlie has large brand deals with Estée Lauder, Carolina Herrera, and Adidas. Other than being a famous supermodel, Karlie has a big interest in technology. Karlie embraced her interest and followed through with learning more about the field, starting by taking coding classes. Being in the class, she was really exposed to how few women there were and became very passionate about the idea of of being able "to share this learning and this access to learning to code and kind of getting girls excited about learning to code." As a result, she created Kode with Klossy: a scholarship coding camp for girls (where this website was made)!</p>

        <p id="ilanaText">Mae Carol Jemison is an American engineer, physician and former NASA astronaut. She became the first black woman to travel in space. She orbited the Earth for nearly eight days on September 12–20, 1992.  Jemison graduated from Stanford University with degrees in chemical engineering as well as African and African-American studies. She then earned her medical degree from Cornell University. Jemison was a doctor for the Peace Corps and worked as a general practitioner. Jemison left NASA in 1993 and founded a technology research company. She later formed a non-profit educational foundation and wrote several books for children and appeared on television several times. She holds several honorary doctorates and has been inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame and the International Space Hall of Fame.</p>

      <p id="ilanaText">Marie Curie was born in Warsaw, Poland and later went to Paris to continue her studies at  Sorbonne where she studied Physics and  Mathematical Sciences. She gained her Doctor of Science degree in 1903 and became a Professor of General Physics in the Faculty of Sciences, the first time a woman had held this position. She was also the Director of the Curie Laboratory, founded in 1914. Together with her husband, she was awarded half of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903, for their study into the spontaneous radiation discovered by Becquerel, who was awarded the other half of the Prize. In 1911 she received a second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, in recognition of her work in radioactivity. She also received the Davy Medal of the Royal Society in 1903 and was awarded one gram of radium..</p>

      <p id="ilanaText">Ada Lovelace is considered to have written instructions for the first computer program in the mid-1800s. The daughter of famed poet Lord Byron, Augusta Ada Byron, Countess of Lovelace—better known as "Ada Lovelace"—was born in London on December 10, 1815. Ada showed her gift for mathematics at an early age. She translated an article on an invention by Charles Babbage, and added her own comments. Because she introduced many computer concepts, Ada is considered the first computer programmer. Ada died on November 27, 1852.</p>
