        <p>Our goals as site developers is to inspire young women like ourselves.  As girls in high school, we are all very invested in learning about STEM and its immense job potential.  We have experienced some of the emotions other girls like us could go and understand the internal struggle one could go through.  The three of us met at a coding camp, where we met many inspirational women who have made an impact in STEM.  We would like to extend this feeling and excitement about this rising industry to everyone.
