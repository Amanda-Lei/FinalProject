        <p id=intro>G.I.R.L.S. in STEM is aimed towards finding opportunities for women and non-binary people and inspiring women to pursue careers in STEM.  Through the mentorship program, women are encouraged to pursue STEM by being exposed to role models.  These mentors provide advice, programming help, and simply someone to look up to during hardships.  Also, G.I.R.L.S. in STEM exposes more women and non-binary people to different women in the news that have paved the way for them and have changed the world.  Our mission is to inspire young girls to pursue careers in Math, Science, Technology, and Engineering. Many girls struggle finding sources of inspiration and lack guidance from their schools to connect with individuals who have already entered the workforce.  The goal is to spread light on what and ignite excitement in girls who would otherwise not felt accepted.

          <p>Without a mentor or people to look up to, it becomes mentally straining to be the only woman in the room.  Women are pushed to constantly prove themselves when they are in a predominantly male environment which leads feelings of loneliness and exhaustion.  Therefore, it is extremely important for more women to have support systems through mentors.  *** The gender gap in STEM is not new.  Right now, only 28% of the computer science workforce is female, 15% engineering, and 26% in mathematical sciences.   A theory long disproved, it was at one point common belief that there are inherent differences in the brains of either sex that explains the difference in interest level.  However, it is believed that it is society’s stigmas and expectations that are to blame.  Every day, society places judgements and preexisting attitudes contribute to the apparent opinions on the topic.  For example, in a study conducted in 2001, teachers were more likely to give girl students a low score on a test than their male counterparts.

          <p>How you can help eliminate the gender gap can be as easy as opening your mind.  Read, write, and share in order to get a perspective on how important this issue is.  Our resources of inspirational women and mentors are intended to raise awareness about the impact women can have in STEM industries.  The more awareness that is raised, the more impact this site will have on female empowerment.  You may ask yourself, what can you do? Allies: By encouraging companies to change their interview processes and broaden their applicant scope, more women will be hired in STEM fields.  Also, by fostering a supportive environment for women in the workspace, more women are likely to feel inspired in said workspace and welcomed.  For women and non-binary people: Explore different careers! Through the mentorship program, you can be exposed to a multitude of careers and find your passion.   Once you find your passion, go for it and work your hardest to reach your goals!</p>
